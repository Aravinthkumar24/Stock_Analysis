# Stock_Analysis
This project automates Nifty 50 stock analysis using Python, Pandas, Streamlit, and Power BI. Raw YAML data is cleaned and converted to CSVs, producing metrics like returns, volatility, and monthly top gainers or losers. Interactive dashboards offer insights into trends, performance, risk, and sector behavior.
